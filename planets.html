            <h1>Explore the Solar System: The 7 Major Planets</h2>

            <p>The solar system is the name for the sun and everything that travels around itâ€”including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The sun is at the center, and its gravity keeps everything else in orbit. Let's look at seven of the most important planets in our solar system (excluding Earth, since you already live here!):</p>

        <section id="content">
            <ul>
                <li>Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the sun. It has no atmosphere and is covered in craters.</li>
                <li>Venus is almost the same size as Earth, but its thick clouds trap heat and make it the hottest planet.</li>
                <li>Mars is known as the red planet. It has dust storms, giant volcanoes, and signs that water once flowed there.</li>
                <li>Jupiter is the biggest planet. It has dozens of moons and a huge storm called the Great Red Spot.</li>
                <li>Saturn is known for its amazing rings made of ice and rock</li>
                <li>Uranus spins on its side and is a cold, pale-blue gas giant.</li>
                <li>Neptune is the farthest planet. It's deep blue and has strong winds and storms</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each planet is different in temperature, color, and size. Some are rocky, and others are made mostly of gas. Scientists use telescopes and space probes to keep learning new things about them.</p>
